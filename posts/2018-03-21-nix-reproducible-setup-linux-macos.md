title: "Nix: A Reproducible Setup for Linux and macOS"
---

This post describes how I set up a reproducible development environment in a
few seconds on any Linux distribution (and potentially macOS as well). This
setup includes simple executables (curl, git) but also programs with custom
configurations and dotfiles (`vim`, `tmux`). The Nix language is used to
describe the system configuration, which you can find [on github][homies] and
follow along.

Developers have access to wonderful tools, which, when leveraged appropriately,
allow them to build wonderful things in no time. Some of these tools, like vim
and Emacs, can be customized to the point that working with them becomes a
second nature, and some people will put a lot of effort into making sure that
their setup is tailored for their workflows. This sometimes involves spending
hours fighting with dependencies, plugins, language syntax highlighters… only
to wake up the next day and realize that their daily update broke everything.

I've used [GNU stow][stow]. I've stored my dotfiles [in a Git
repository][dotfiles].  I've written scripts to extract and load sets of
packages with `aptitude`.  It never worked reliably. Now I have a solution that
actually works. I'm using a few text files that describe my entire setup, store
them on GitHub, and don't anymore fear upgrading my system, losing my laptop or
spawning short-lived development instances. Let me show you how.

_If you've never heard of Nix, worry not, the next section will present its
main concepts. If you've used Nix before, feel free to [skip ahead](#nixos).
The sections are mostly independent, pick any one that is most relevant to
you:_

## Nix and NixOS

[Nix][nix] is a programming language with unconventional properties, which was
developed mostly to work as a package manager. Today we are not going to focus
much on the language itself, but on the package management model and how it
fits in Unix systems. Check out Jim Fisher's
[post][nix-by-example] for a
good introduction to the language itself. From now on I may use "Nix"
interchangeably for both the language and the package manager.

Here's a quote from the [Nix manual][nix-manual]:

> In Nix, packages are stored in unique locations in the Nix store (typically,
> /nix/store). For instance, a particular version of the Subversion package
> might be stored in a directory
> `/nix/store/dpmvp969yhdqs7lm2r1a3gng7pyq6vy4-subversion-1.1.3/`, while
> another version might be stored in
> `/nix/store/5mq2jcn36ldlmh93yj1n8s9c95pj7c5s-subversion-1.1.2`. The long
> strings prefixed to the directory names are cryptographic hashes of all
> inputs involved in building the package — sources, dependencies, compiler
> flags, and so on. So if two packages differ in any way, they end up in
> different locations in the file system, so they don’t interfere with each
> other.


This captures the essence of Nix. All this package building is described
through a set of Nix files (with a `.nix` extension). Nix does _not_ actually
have a package archive: all it has is a package repository _description_,
[`nixpkgs`][nixpkgs], which is nothing but a bunch of Nix files! Nix downloads
those files and prepares the packages on your machine. Most of it, however, was
already built and cached, so after installing Nix you should be able to
download any package from `nixpkgs`' cache:

``` shell
$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh # install Nix
$ . $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh # make sure it's loaded
$ nix-env -i blender # download Blender and all its dependencies
installing 'blender-2.79a'
these paths will be fetched (65.18 MiB download, 302.81 MiB unpacked):
  /nix/store/0ary8jr20s5x2h6k83r4c1i5bh4ildjk-soxr-0.1.2
  /nix/store/0ivvxa7gli2lhsxsscgvycbzsbjj5l8w-python3-3.5.5
  /nix/store/0my884iq9l5w27wnslr0npnw8bbdx8mb-speexdsp-1.2rc3
  /nix/store/0nl0wmi37b6f338f8v0j60cvwciv602h-openjpeg-1.5.2
  ...
$ blender # have some fun with Blender
```

Check out the [Nix manual][nix-manual] and the [Nix Pills][nix-pills] for a
deeper introduction.

### NixOS

There actually is an entire operating system based on Nix: [NixOS][nixos].
Everything, from your packages to the services and users, is described with
Nix. Using NixOS is a great solution if you can afford it. Using the Nix
package manager alone is much more lightweight, as you can always piggy back on
your distribution's package manager if you _need_ to, and you can always get
rid of Nix entirely (including everything it's ever installed) by wiping
`/nix`. I, personally, only need a single user on my system, and no services
besides the ones provided by Ubuntu by default, so the setup I describe below
is perfect.

## Package management

I'll start by showing you how I curate the set of packages installed on my
system at all times: my [homies][homies]. Let's have a look at the main
`homies` Nix file, [`default.nix`][homies-default]:

``` nix
# default.nix
let
  pkgs = import (import ./nixpkgs) {};

  bashrc = …;
  git = …;
  tmux = …;
  vim = …;

  homies =
    [
      # Customized packages
      bashrc
      git
      tmux
      vim

      # Sourced directly from Nixpkgs
      pkgs.curl
      pkgs.htop
      pkgs.nix
      pkgs.pass
      pkgs.tree
      pkgs.xclip
    ];

in … homies
```

The `let … in …` is a typical functional programming construct: it defines some
values after the `let` and brings them into scope after the `in`. A few values
are defined:

* `pkgs`: where we'll draw our packages from -- you don't _have_ to use
  `nixpkgs`!
* `bashrc`, `git`, `tmux`, `vim`: some packages I customized for my needs,
  we'll get to what exactly that means in the next sections.
* `homies`: the list of packages that I want to be installed on my system.

If you've never had any exposure to functional programming, the code above
might look somewhat strange: that's fine. You should nevertheless be able to
tailor it to your needs by adding some packages sourced from `nixpkgs` (e.g.
`pkgs.blender` or `pkgs.firefox`) to the `homies` list.

The following command removes all your (Nix-) installed packages and replaces
them with the ones defined in `default.nix`:

``` shell
$ nix-env -f default.nix -i --remove-all
building '/nix/store/g9v8mgzp0j4ndswdf4s04lkryw26qr0p-user-environment.drv'...
created 289 symlinks in user environment
```

Let's deconstruct what's happening:

* `nix-env`: this is the command that deals with installing packages on and
  removing packages from your system.
* `-f default.nix`: by default `nix-env` will look for packages in `nixpkgs`;
  by specifying `default.nix` we actually instruct it not to install the
  _whole_ set of packages defined in `nixpkgs`…
* `-i`: "install".
* `--remove-all`: instruct `nix-env` to remove all the packages previously
  installed.

All the `homies` packages are now installed. There might be something bugging
you:

* Aren't all packages located at a `/nix/store/XXXXXXX-foo`-style path?
* Wasn't I lead to believe that wiping `/nix` would get rid of nix?
* How can the packages be present on my `$PATH` then; did Nix just tinker with
  my `$PATH` !?

Nix didn't tinker with your `$PATH`, or at least not just now. During the
installation of Nix itself, you might have been asked to add the following line
to your `.bashrc`/`.profile`:

``` shell
. $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
```

What this small shell script does is very simple (in its essence): it adds
`$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/` to your `$PATH`. When you run `nix-env -i` (as we did
above) Nix will build the packages in a temporary directory, store them in a
`/nix/store/XXXXXXX-foo`-style location (a so-called entry in the Nix store),
and create a symlink in `$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/` to the newly created entry in
the Nix store. This is very powerful because Nix can perform atomic updates,
without ever erasing packages: it only updates the symlinks if the whole build
was successful. This enables very interesting operations, like rolling back to
a previous "generation" (a generation is created on every successful `nix-env
-i` call):

``` shell
$ nix-env --list-generations
  ...
  40   2018-03-11 20:25:41
  41   2018-03-17 11:03:52
  42   2018-03-18 20:39:10   (current)
$ nix-env --rollback
switching from generation 42 to 41
$ nix-env --list-generations
  ...
  40   2018-03-11 20:25:41
  41   2018-03-17 11:03:52   (current)
  42   2018-03-18 20:39:10
$ nix-env --switch-generation 42
switching from generation 41 to 42
```

(No, it's not on purpose, I just happen to be at generation _42_...)

You might start to wonder how this is possible, since built packages take up
space and that space is limited. You can run garbage collection runs whenever
you feel like it, which you can read more about
[here][nix-gc].

You now know how to perform basic package installs from a `.nix` file.
Congratulations! Next, let's see how to manage dotfiles.

## Packaging up the dotfiles: tmux and vim

As mentioned above, part of the `homies` are sourced directly from `nixpkgs`
(`curl`, `htop`, …) while others are _customized_ (in particular `tmux` and
`vim`). The reason is that I use the former ones directly, while the latter
ones I want to use with a dotfile, like `.tmux.conf` and `.vimrc`. We'll start
with packaging your beloved `.tmux.conf` with Nix (you can find `vim` in the
[next section](#vim)).

My `homies` have a [special directory dedicated to `tmux`][homies-tmux], which
you might think of as a "module" (although [modules in Nix][nixos-modules] are
something else):

``` shell
$ tree tmux/
tmux
├── default.nix
└── tmux.conf

0 directories, 2 files
```

You might have expected `tmux.conf`, which is exactly what you expect it to be.
Let's look at `tmux/default.nix` instead!

``` nix
# Tmux with ./tmux.conf baked in
{ tmux, writeText, symlinkJoin, makeWrapper }:
symlinkJoin {
  name = "tmux";
  buildInputs = [makeWrapper];
  paths = [ tmux ];
  postBuild = ''
    wrapProgram "$out/bin/tmux" \
    --add-flags "-f ${./tmux.conf}"
  '';
}
```

There are a few things going on, but we can ignore most of that. We will focus on the following part:

``` nix
  … = ''
    wrapProgram "$out/bin/tmux" \
    --add-flags "-f ${./tmux.conf}"
  '';
```

First, the double (single-)quotes `''`: that's a string. What's inside the
string is mostly bash. What's not bash is the `${./tmux.conf}` part: that's a
way of referencing Nix values inside a bash statement -- and inside any string,
actually. To Nix, this snippet is just a string, it will just happen to be run
as a bash script at some point. So `${ foo }` interpolates the _Nix_ value
`./tmux.conf` to a string. The next question is: what kind of value is
`./tmux.conf`?

Wanna have a guess?

Well, it looks like a path, doesn't it. And as it turns out there is a file
[`tmux.conf`][homies-tmux-conf] in the directory. A Nix value that starts with
`./` is Nix' quick way of creating an entry in the Nix store: by interpolating
it in the snippet above, Nix will replace `${ ./tmux.conf }` with a
`/nix/store/XXXXXXX-foo`-style path. Sweet! The rest of the obscure incantation
is just a way of telling Nix to wrap `tmux` (some `tmux` that was built by Nix
and lives in `/nix/store`) and bake in the `-f` flag which specifies the
location of the `.tmux.conf` file to use. You can convince yourself of it by
squinting long enough at the actual `tmux` that's located on my `$PATH`:

``` shell
$ cat $(which tmux)
#! /nix/store/q1g0rl8zfmz7r371fp5p42p4acmv297d-bash-4.4-p19/bin/bash -e
exec -a "$0" \
    "/nix/store/7wxr8q4jga59my8j283d2qb9vsxnhja6-tmux/bin/.tmux-wrapped"    \
    #                                                       ^               \
    #                               some weird symlink name 」              \
    #                                                                       \
    #                           the tmux.conf file  ﹁                      \
    -f /nix/store/jrixfc4b897cxwr8wbqb90xqskrax0qh-tmux.conf "${extraFlagsArray[@]}" "$@"
```

And just like that, your beloved `.tmux.conf` is baked in your `tmux`! Next,
vim and `vimrc`!

## vim

Let's now bundle `vim` with a `vimrc` and some plugins. Maybe you've had this
experience:

* Plugin A needs python 2.7,
* Plugin B needs python 3.0,
* Plugin C needs python 2.8, which is a special flavor of python 2.7.8 that can
  only be compiled during full moon.

You might expect the `vim` setup to be a bit more complex, mostly because of
plugins, but in practice it is fairly easy. Because the [`nixpkgs`][nixpkgs]
are hosted on GitHub, anybody is free to submit a pull request, and a bit of
infrastructure was merged in for `vim` plugin support.

The python version (_versionssss_) issue mentioned above is completely
alleviated with Nix, because the plugins themselves can specify their system
dependencies, and different versions of Python/what-have-you can happily
cohabit with one another. Here's my complete vim setup:

``` nix
# vim/default.nix

{ symlinkJoin, makeWrapper, vim_configurable, vimUtils, vimPlugins, haskellPackages }:
let
  pluginDictionaries = with vimPlugins;
    [
      ctrlp
      fugitive
      gitgutter
      nerdcommenter
      nerdtree
      surround
      syntastic
      tmux-navigator
      vim-airline
      vim-indent-guides
      vim-markdown
      vim-multiple-cursors
      vim-nix
      vim-trailing-whitespace
      vimproc
      youcompleteme
    ];
  customRC = vimUtils.vimrcFile
    { customRC = builtins.readFile ./vimrc;
      packages.mvc.start = extraPackages;
    };
in
symlinkJoin {
  name = "vim";
  buildInputs = [makeWrapper];
  postBuild = ''
    wrapProgram "$out/bin/vim" \
        --add-flags "-u ${customRC}" \
        --prefix PATH : ${haskellPackages.hasktags}/bin
  '';
  paths = [ vim_configurable ];
}
```

(and the [`./vimrc`][homies-vimrc] file:)


``` vim
" vim/vimrc

let mapleader=","
set encoding=utf-8

set nocompatible

"allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
set backspace=indent,eol,start

…

" Run hasktags on buffer write
:autocmd BufWritePost *.hs
    \ silent!
    \ !(hasktags --ignore-close-implementation --ctags .; sort tags)
    \ &> /dev/null

…
```

The `vimrc` file itself is sourced from the file in my [homies
repository][homies] (although in a different way than the `.tmux.conf` file
from the previous section) and lists _zero_ plugins. Those are magically
handled by the `vimUtils.vimrcFile` function.

You might recognize the obscure `wrapProgram` incantation that we used with
`tmux` earlier, which this time instructs `vim` to start with `-u …`.  This is
how we tell `vim` to use the Nix generated `vimrc`. But now, we pass a second
argument to `wrapProgram`:

``` shell
--prefix PATH : ${haskellPackages.hasktags}/bin
```

The reason for that is that I trigger `hasktags` -- a Haskell ctags generator
-- upon a Haskell file save, and `--prefix PATH …` will ensure that `hasktags`
is in `$PATH` when `vim` is invoked. This used to be a pain to deal with, as I
had to remember to also install the `hasktags` program after setting up my
`dotfiles` on a new machine. Now the dependency is stored with my `homies`!

**Take home message**: `vim` configuration does **not** have to be a pain. And
you should **not** have to log in into your development boxes with a stripped
down, unfamiliar default vim configuration. Bring your homies along. It's so
easy.

## Cowsay: The nix-shell

Alright, buckle up now, we're getting real. I've talked about my so-called
"homies" -- the packages that I like having around -- for a while now, and you
might have wondered how I survive with those sad 10 packages (I counted).
Here's my answer: I don't. Does that make sense? No? Then let me introduce the
8th Wonder of the World, the `nix-shell`:

``` shell
$ cowsay the nix-shell
The program 'cowsay' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install cowsay
$ nix-shell -p cowsay
these paths will be fetched (0.01 MiB download, 0.03 MiB unpacked):
  /nix/store/w5v5l3799zn7cvrsqa3s307rqy7rrckn-cowsay-3.03+dfsg1-16
copying path '/nix/store/w5v5l3799zn7cvrsqa3s307rqy7rrckn-cowsay-3.03+dfsg1-16' from 'http://cache.nixos.org'...

[nix-shell]$ cowsay the nix-shell
 _______________
< the nix-shell >
 ---------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

[nix-shell]$ exit
$ cowsay the nix-shell
The program 'cowsay' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install cowsay
```

The `nix-shell` is the Nix equivalent of a one-night stand. It will bring
packages in scope for the lifetime of a shell (this time not through symlinks:
it crafts a special `$PATH` for the new shell). The simplest usage is the one
showcased above -- `nix-shell -p package1 -p package2 …` -- which makes
`package1`, `package2`, … available in your current shell session. After you've
exited the shell, they're gone.

The notion of a "package" in Nix is somewhat laxer than in, say, `aptitude`.
Here's a valid `nix-shell` invocation:

``` shell
$ nix-shell -p "python3.withPackages (ps: [ ps.numpy ps.tensorflow ])"
these derivations will be built:
  /nix/store/sqy5nxzyy0z9vi01xxpyn6ycf8d4wc82-python3-3.6.4-env.drv

```

And that's how you install Python and tensorflow. Sweet, heh?

Another way to use the `nix-shell` is to write a `shell.nix` file, which is
evaluated when you call `nix-shell`.  As it turns out, my homies are simply the
packages that I regularly use _outside of code repositories_ (by the way if you
haven't tried the [homies][homies], the easiest way is to copy the repository
and run `nix-shell` inside it). The `nix-shell` is amazing when working on code
with others; just drop a `shell.nix` with **all** (and I mean **all**) the
system dependencies for building and running the project in a `shell.nix`, and
the rest of your team will thank you for it. For more info, check out
[zimbatm][zimbatm]'s talk on [Sneaking Nix at $work][sneaking-nix-at-work].

This was a quick introduction to the `nix-shell`, or how to install packages
for a very short lifetime or project-local scope. The concept is simple but the
potential is huge. Go ahead and try it out!

**Pro-tip**: Add the following to your `bashrc` for Haskell one-offs (or copy
[mine][homies-bashrc]):

``` bash
ghc-shell() {
  nix-shell -p "haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (ps: with ps; [ $* ])"
}

ghci-with() {
  nix-shell \
    -p "haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (ps: with ps; [ $* ])" \
    --run ghci
}
```

## Conclusion

That's it for today. We went through the underlying concepts of the Nix package
manager, learned how to package tools with customized configuration in a
declarative and reproducible way and finally went through a few example use
cases of the `nix-shell`. I'd like to thank [zimbatm][zimbatm] and [Graham
Christensen][grahamc] for proofreading this text and suggesting improvements.
Thanks, guys!

**P.S.**: Nix is not an all-or-nothing package manager, you can install
it today, write some configuration, wipe it entirely tomorrow and start where
you left it next week -- your configuration will still work. You might want to
start by installing a few packages on your machine, or drop a `shell.nix` in a
project that has a few system dependencies that are tricky to install; it's up
to you!
