In order to warm up for a round of interviews next week, I've been playing
around with coding puzzles. Those are usually solved using imperative
languages, and I thought I'd have a go at them using Haskell. I'll share
today's experience, which hopefully will convince you that purely functional
languages are (sometimes) suitable for puzzles.

*This is a literate Haskell file. You can find this code on
[Github](https://github.com/nmattia/nmattia.com/blob/master/posts/2016-07-31-bfs-tree.lhs) and follow along in `ghci`.*

Disclaimer

*There is probably nothing new here. Also, there might be better
solutions to solve the problem. I like this solution because it gave me an
excuse to showcase Haskell's laziness. Feel free to ping me if you come up with
something better.*

The puzzle
---

Let's start with the problem itself. You are given a number, $x_0$, and a
target, $x_f$. You are allowed two functions:
    $f(x) = 2 x + 1$
and
    $g(x) = 3 x + 1 \; .$

Give either the minimal number of applications of $f$ and $g$ that you need in
order to reach $x_f$ from $x_0$, or state that one cannot reach $x_f$ from $x_0$.

For instance:

 * in order to reach $x_f = 4$ from $x_0= 1$, you need one application:

      $x_f = 4 = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 = g(1) = g(x_0)$

 * in order to reach $x_f = 10$ from $x_0= 1$, you need two applications:

      $x_f = 10 = 3 \cdot 3 + 1 = g(3) = g(2 \cdot 1 + 1) = g \circ f (1) = g \circ f (x_0)$

 * you cannot reach $x_f = 8$ from $x_0 = 1$.

I like to think of the values as a tree where each node has degree $2$. To get
to a left child, apply $f$. To get to a right child, apply $g$. In this case
the answer is equal to the depth of $x_f$, where the root is $x_0$. Now you
just need to traverse the tree, starting from the root, until you find $x_f$.
Using the following observation:

 * $4 \cdot x \gt 3 \cdot x + 1, \forall x \gt 1$

we know that we can safely stop whenever we hit a node with depth $d \gt 4
\cdot x$.

Clearly the number of nodes traversed (assuming a BFS) is proportional to the
exponential of the depth (it is actually $2^d$). But we also know that there is
at least a factor $2$ between each "layer" ($\forall x \gt 0, f(x) \gt 2x$). So
we can conclude that $x_f
- x_0 > 2 ^ d$ and so our algorithm should run in $O(x_f - x_0)$. Now let's
  write some code.

The code
---

> import System.Environment (getArgs)

First we need to define a suitable tree structure. We define a binary tree in
which each node holds some data. The data we will record is the node's depth
(or distance from the root) and a value:

> data Tree = T { depth  :: !Int
>               , value  :: !Int
>               , l      :: Tree
>               , r      :: Tree }

We keep the links to the children lazy so that we can build an infinite tree.
Whenever we create a node it is very likely that we will need the data it
contains, so we keep the data strict. This is a typical lazy spine/strict
leaves structure, and has the added bonus of easily allowing GHC to unpack the
`Int`s.

Now, let's build that tree:

> mkTree :: Int -> Tree
> mkTree = go 0
>   where
>     go d v = T { depth = d
>                , value = v
>                , l     = go (d + 1) (2 * v + 1)
>                , r     = go (d + 1) (3 * v + 1) }

Note that we don't have to limit ourselves to the functions $f$ and $g$.
Here's, for instance, a complete binary tree:

> -- As an example
> completeBinaryTree :: Tree
> completeBinaryTree = go 0 1
>   where
>     go d v = T { depth = d
>                , value = v
>                , l     = go (d + 1) (2 * v )
>                , r     = go (d + 1) (2 * v + 1) }

This second tree would look like this:

<img src="/images/complete-binary-tree.jpg" style="width:512px;padding:15px" />

Now comes the fun part, the breadth-first search (note that you typically don't
want to do a depth-first on an infinite tree). A typical implementation of a
BFS uses a queue. It would go something like this:

  * Dequeue a node from the queue and append it to an output list.
  * Enqueue all this node's children.
  * Repeat until your queue is empty.

This is a simplified version that will work just fine for a tree (we don't need
to check whether or not we have already visited the current node).  If you know
your functional data structures, you'll recognize a typical queue:

``` haskell
data Queue a = Queue { front :: [a]
                     , back  :: [a] }
```

Whenever you want to enqueue a value, you cons it on `back`. Whenever you want
to dequeue a value, you uncons it from front. And whenever front is empty you
replace it with back (in reverse order). This gives you worst-case `O(1)` for
enqueue and dequeue operations, and `O(n)` for tail (that's where you'll
reverse the back, see Okasaki's [Purely Functional
Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf) for a good
overview).

The search
---

Easy enough. Now we just need a `State Queue` monad, traverse the tree, and
update our queue every time, discarding the old one. Also, we'll need a `Writer
[Tree]` to output the nodes. Right? Well, in our case we can do much simpler.
We will simply use a list and take advantage of the language's laziness. We'll
take a list of nodes and return a list of their children. It will extract the
left and right children of a node, then move to the next node, repeat the
process and concat the result.

``` haskell
children = concatMap (\t -> [l t, r t]) nodes
```

All good. Now we just need to bootstrap it:

> bfs :: Tree -> [Tree]
> bfs root =
>   let
>     nodes = root : children
>     children = concatMap (\t -> [l t, r t]) nodes
>   in nodes

Let's check it out on our binary tree in `ghci`:

``` haskell
λ: value <$> take 10 (bfs completeBinaryTree)
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```

Sweet! When `concatMap` is called the first time, it'll split the root into its
left and right children. This means that the root's left child is now the
second element in `nodes`. When `concatMap` has to work again, it'll spit out
first the left child's own children, then the right child's own children, etc,
concating the children lists every time.  Looks like we have a breadth-first
search using a list instead of a queue! And added bonus, we got rid of
`Queue`'s `O(n)` worst case, since we never even `tail`!

<img src="/images/queue-moving-window.jpg" style="width:512px;padding:15px" />

In this case, a queue is nothing more than a window, or slice, of a list.
Every time we enqueue, we expand the window to the right. Every time we dequeue,
we shrink the window on the left. This is unfortunately not an all purpose
queue. Once the first cell of the list is created, all the remaining ones must
be determined already.

The only thing left to do is to traverse the nodes produced by `bfs` until we
hit either $x_f$ or a number that we know is too large:

> distance :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
> distance x0 xf = go nodes
>   where
>     nodes = bfs $ mkTree x0
>     go (t:ts) | value t == xf     = Just $ depth t
>               | value t > 4 * xf  = Nothing -- from analysis
>               | otherwise         = go ts
>

*Et voilà!* We can go a bit fancy and add a cli (that will happily crash on you
on bad input):

> main :: IO ()
> main = do
>   [x0, xf] <- (read <$>) <$> getArgs
>   print $ distance x0 xf

Compiled with

```
$ ghc --make -O2 -funbox-strict-fields bfs-tree.lhs
```

the program runs to up to 10,000,000,000 under two seconds, which is not too
bad. (Dell XPS 13, 2015)

To get it to run on larger inputs, I suspect one would need to find a better
algorithm. It would maybe even allow replacing `Int`s with `Integer`s. Once
again, if you do find something, please get in touch : )
