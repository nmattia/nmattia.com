Last week a friend of mine asked me how I would implement the game
[2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) in Java (at least the update
logic) and we gave it a try. It went something like this:

 * So we need to represent the grid. I guess `int[][]` will do. Is this going
   to be an array of rows, or an array of columns? Either way we'll need to
   stick to it. *huh*

 * Actually, it'll be a sparse array, because not every cell will contain a
   value at all times. So an array of `Maybe int`. Oh right, `Integer`. We'll
   need to remember to null-check. *huh*

 * The easiest would be to define the function to update a row/column once, and
   then apply it to the grid in different directions. Extract a row/column,
   process it, and place it back. Keeping track of the indices. *huh*


It is actually a problem that can be solved elegantly in Haskell using a few
[Iso](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.14/docs/Control-Lens-Iso.html)s
and
[Traversal](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.14/docs/Control-Lens-Traversal.html)s.
We'll use the [linear](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear) library for
representing the data and the [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens)
library for accessing it.

*You can find this code on [Github](https://github.com/nmattia/2048-lens) and
follow along in `ghci`.*

### Preparing the datatypes

We'll represent our board as a $4 \times 4$ matrix from linear:

<div style="text-align:center">
``` haskell
type Board = M44 (Maybe (Sum Integer))
```
</div>

This is a simple, row-major matrix from linear. In order to make our life
simpler we'll define a function to display the board:

``` haskell
λ: let display :: Board -> IO (); display = Boxes.printBox . mkBox
```

I made `Board` an instance of `Default`, so we can instantiate our first board as follows:

``` haskell
λ: let board = def :: Board
```

Let's have a look:


``` haskell
λ: display board
X  X  X  X

X  X  X  X

X  X  X  X

X  X  X  X
```

Alright, nothing too exciting yet. This is simply a board filled with
`Nothing`s. We'll use this to start discovering linear's vector and matrix
representation. A matrix of type `M44` is nothing but a vector of vectors,
stored in row-major order; a vector of matrix rows:


<div style="text-align:center">
``` haskell
type M44 a = V4 (V4 a)  -- Defined in ‘Linear.Matrix’
```
</div>

The library has four very basic lenses for indexing into a vector: `_x`, `_y`,
`_z` and `_w`. Let's go to the *second row* (`_y`) of our board and set the
*fourth element* (`_w`):

``` haskell

λ: import Control.Lens
λ: display $ board & _y . _w .~ (Just 2)
X  X  X  X

X  X  X  2

X  X  X  X

X  X  X  X
```

And it's just that easy! Linear has a few other lenses for accessing elements
and even vectors inside matrices. I definitely recommend checking it out.

### 22 Lines of logic

Let's get back to our game. We first need an update function for the
rows/columns. The game 2048 actually does not care about empty cells, wherever
they are, it'll just ignore them:

<div style="text-align:center">
```
2 X 2 X             X X X 4
-------     --->    -------
X X 2 2             X X X 4
```
</div>

In this small example the user swiped right, and even though the rows differed,
the result was the same (it's not injective). We'll simply take a list
containing the non-empty cells as an input, and output a list of the resulting
non-empty cells. Here are a few examples:


```
[2, 2]    -> [4]
[1, 2, 2] -> [1, 4]
[2, 1, 2] -> [2, 1, 2]
[2, 2, 2] -> [4, 2]
```

We'll specify some rules that might not correspond exactly to what the original
game uses, but that will be good enough for us. When traversing a list:

<div style="text-align:center">
*If two neighbors are equal, replace them by their sum.*
</div>

The above is easily translated to Haskell code:

``` haskell
merge :: (Eq a, Monoid a) => [a] -> [a]
merge (x:x':xs) | x == x' = (x <> x') : merge xs
merge (x:xs)              = x : merge xs
merge []                  = []
```

*Note that we've used a slightly more abstract version than `[Int] -> [Int]`.
This is useful for several reasons. For instance you might not have decided yet
what type you are going to use to represent your cells (Int? Integer? An
enumeration of the powers of two?). Also you might want to add a UI. In this
case you will want to remember which cells were merged together so that you can
play an animation. Below we will be using `Sum Integer`, the integers with addition
as the monoidal composition (`<>`). *

There's not much room for error. GHC infers that we have covered all input
cases, and we only need to make sure that the code reflects the rule above. We
can open up `ghci` and verify with our (limited) test-suite:

``` haskell
λ: merge [2, 2] :: [Sum Integer]
[4]

λ: merge [1, 2, 2] :: [Sum Integer]
[1, 4]

λ: merge [2, 1, 2] :: [Sum Integer]
[2, 1, 2]

λ: merge [2, 2, 2] :: [Sum Integer]
[4, 2]
```

Now we need to apply `merge` to different parts of the board. This is where the
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) library comes in handy. More
importantly [linear](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear)'s good support
for various types of lenses, particularly `Iso`s and `Traversal`s. Here's my
(instinctive) understanding of those:

 * If you need to go back and forth between two datatypes `a` and `b`, you'll
   need an `Iso' a b`.
 * If you need to get several `b`s from a datatype `a`, you'll need a
   `Traversal' a b`.

Earlier we prepared a `Board`. Now we have a function that operates on `[a]`.
We'll want to traverse our board to get lists. We'll want a `Traversal' Board
[a]`. Or rather several `Traversal' Board [a]`, one for each of the four
orientations:

``` haskell
rows, wors, cols, locs :: Traversal' (M44 (Maybe  a)) [a]
```

The various directions are represented here:

<img src="/images/rows-wors-cols-locs.jpg" style="width:512px;padding:15px" />

### Setting up our lenses

Let's start with `rows`. Once again, the type `M44` is nothing but a vector of
vectors, or a `V4` of `V4`s.

<img src="/images/v4-v4-m44.jpg" style="width:512px;padding:15px" />

The vector type `V4` is an instance of
[Traversable](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/Data-Traversable.html)
(not *Traversal*, which is a type) so we can use `traverse`:

``` haskell
λ: :t traverse
traverse :: (Applicative f, Traversable t) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
```

Simply put, `traverse` says

<div style="text-align:center">
If your `t` is `Traversable`, I'll give you:

``` haskell
Traversal' (t a) a
```
</div>


Since `M44 a` is `V4 (V4 a))` it says:


<div style="text-align:center">
Your `V4` is `Traversable`, so I'll give you:

``` haskell
Traversal' (M44 (Maybe a)) (V4 (Maybe a))
```
</div>

Good, so now we know how to get/set/act on each row of our board independently.
Problem is that when traversing it, we are given the rows as `V4 (Maybe a)`s.
But our function `merge` works on `[a]`s! Here come the Isos. We need an Iso
that allows us to go back and forth between `V4 (Maybe a)` and `[a]`. The lens
library comes with a handy function `iso` which builds an `Iso` from a pair of
inverse functions. Here's what we'll use:

``` haskell
list :: Iso' (V4 (Maybe a)) [a]
list = iso toList fromList
  where
    toList v = reverse $ catMaybes $ foldl (flip (:)) [] v
    fromList (xs :: [a]) = V4 (xs^?ix 0) (xs^?ix 1) (xs^?ix 2) (xs^?ix 3)
```


We have two operations here: `toList` and `fromList`. The first one simply
copies all the `Just` values of a `V4` into a list, that is

<div style="text-align:center">
``` haskell
toList :: V4 (Maybe a) -> [a]
```
</div>

whereas, on the other hand, `fromList` recreates a vector from a list. Since
there can be fewer than four values in a list, `fromList` adds as many `Just`s
as possible to the `V4`, and fill the rest with `Nothing`s. You will notice
that this also takes care of "shifting" the values to the beginning of the
vector.

And, believe it or not, we're almost done implementing our `rows` function.
Here's the last bit:

``` haskell
rows = traverse . list
```

We traverse our matrix one row at a time, but before handing the row to the
caller, we transform it to a list using `toList`. And when we're handed back a
list, we insert it in the matrix as a row using `fromList`. Let's see the
result by setting all rows to `[1,2,3]`:

``` haskell
λ: display $ board & rows .~ [1,2,3]
1  2  3  X

1  2  3  X

1  2  3  X

1  2  3  X
```

### For a few Isos more

Now, let's get started on `wors`, which should give us the reversed rows (when
reading a row we start from the right-most element). The lens library has
another handy abstraction:
[Reversing](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.14/docs/Control-Lens-Iso.html#t:Reversing).
Any type that is an instance of `Reversing` gets the `reversed` iso for free.
Let's make `V4` an instance of `Reversing`:

``` haskell
instance Reversing (V4 a) where
  reversing v = V4 (v^._w) (v^._z) (v^._y) (v^._x)
```

and `wors` can now be implemented:

```haskell
wors = traverse . reversed . list
```
Facile, non? We get (vector) rows through `traverse`, reverse them, and *then*
turn them into a list.


``` haskell
λ: display $ board & wors .~ [1,2,3]
X  3  2  1

X  3  2  1

X  3  2  1

X  3  2  1
```

On to the next one: `cols`. Getting columns is easy: transpose the matrix. The
columns of the original matrix are now the rows of the transposed matrix.
Earlier we used the `iso` function to build an `Iso'` between `V4 (Maybe a)`
and `[a]`. We'll use it again to create an `Iso` between a matrix and its
transposed self:

``` haskell
transposed :: Iso' (M44 a) (M44 a)
transposed = iso transpose transpose
```

*(If you know of a function `f = join iso`, please ping me. I couldn't find
it.)*

And now the two implementations for the columns and reversed columns:

``` haskell
cols = transposed . rows
locs = transposed . wors
```

``` haskell
λ: display $ board & cols .~ [1,2,3]
1  1  1  1
          
2  2  2  2
          
3  3  3  3
          
X  X  X  X

λ: display $ board & locs .~ [1,2,3]
X  X  X  X
          
3  3  3  3
          
2  2  2  2
          
1  1  1  1
```

### Extra lens goodness

And that's it, we've implemented the logic of the game! Believe it or not, it
didn't take us more than 22 lines of code. But make no mistake. Lenses aren't
for code golfing.  They're just well-crafted, type-safe abstractions. A lot of
code was already written on top of those, meaning there's a lot of stuff you
can reuse. Also, when used properly, they should allow you to write less of
your own code. I believe that (other things being equal) it is always better:
less room for mistakes, less code to maintain, less code newcomers have to
understand.

As opposed to the simplistic Java given in the introduction:

 * We don't care (too much) if a matrix is a vector of rows or a vector or
   columns (row-major or column-major). The Linear library abstracts this for
   us and gives us a few functions to use in order to traverse the matrix.

 * No null checks.

 * Thanks to lens, we haven't used a single index explicitly. All the getting,
   updating and setting of values was declarative. Each indexing of an element
   has its own function: if an element is not there, the function is not there.

Finally, we can wire everything together, making use this time of lens'
support for actions in the state monad:

``` haskell
data Action = Up | Down | Left | Right

play :: (MonadState Board m) => Action -> m ()
play Up    = cols %= merge
play Down  = locs %= merge
play Left  = rows %= merge
play Right = wors %= merge
```
