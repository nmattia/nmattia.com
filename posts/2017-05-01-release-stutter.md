title: "Stutter: the anti-grep"
---

I'm going to introduce [`stutter`](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter), a
command line tool for generating strings. I'll first show some examples, then
talk a bit about the performance and finally about the implementation (for the
Haskell friendly reader).

<!--more-->

This short introduction was motivated by a recent [post on
reddit](https://redd.it/66o3lp) where the author was looking for something
similar (though packaged as a library).

## Examples

In its essence, `stutter` does the opposite of what `grep` does. You pass
`grep` a definition string and it will find all the matches in the input you
provide it. You pass `stutter` a definition string and it will generate an
output based on that string:


``` sh
$ echo 'foo\nbar\nbaz' | grep -E 'foo|bar|baz'
foo
bar
baz

$ stutter 'foo|bar|baz'
foo
bar
baz
```

The most basic usage would be to use `stutter` as an `echo` clone:

``` sh
$ echo 'foo'
foo

$ stutter 'foo'
foo
```

Though `stutter` will go further, and allow you to define the output strings in
various ways. For instance, you might want either `foo` _or_ `bar`. You can use
the sum operator `|` as in the following snippet:

``` sh
$ stutter 'foo|bar'
foo
bar
```

Both `foo` and `bar` will appear, but not together. To go back to the first
example, let's simply drop `echo` so we can better see the parallel between
`grep` and `stutter`:

``` sh
$ stutter 'foo|bar|baz' | grep -E 'foo|bar|baz'
foo
bar
baz
```

There is an equivalent product operator `#` if you need both `foo` _and_ `bar`:


``` sh
$ stutter 'foo#bar'
foobar
```

In this example you could have simply run `stutter 'foobar'` to get the same
result, but sometimes the `#` operator can come in handy (see for instance the
fold operator `{|}` in the readme's
[examples](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter#examples)). Let's see another
important construct, namely the grouping operator `()`. Say you want either
`foo` _and_ `bar` _or_ `foo` _and_ `baz`:

``` sh
$ stutter 'foo(bar|baz)'
foobar
foobaz
```

Two things to notice:

1. The `()` operator is optional for groups of one element. It was not
   necessary to write `(foo)(bar|baz)`. `stutter` will assume a group is ending
   on the first operator occurrence. If you need to use operator characters,
   you can escape them with a backslash (`\ `) character.
1. The `#` operator is used by default when no other operator is found. It was
   not necessary to write `foo#(bar|baz)`.

There are more examples in the `stutter`
[readme](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter#examples) showcasing things like
repetition, sourcing files and `stdin`, character ranges, and more.

## Performance

As much as possible `stutter` tries to only use constant memory. The heap
should never grow as long as you stick to "pure" string generations, even if
you perform products of infinite lists of words. However the situation is
different with "unpure" string generation, for instance when sourcing words
from `stdin`. `stutter` will do its best to keep the memory usage low. The
following for instance will zip `stdin` with itself:

``` sh
$ cat some_big_file
line001
line002
line003
...
$ cat some_big_file | stutter '(@-)$(@-)'
line001line001
line002line002
line003line003
...
```

The zip operator `$` will zip two outputs together, and the `@-` group will be
replaced by the content read from `stdin`. The example above will still run in
constant space, because `stutter` realizes that it can discard a line from
`stdin` as soon as it was printed. The situation is different with products:

``` sh
$ cat some_big_file | stutter '(@-)#(@-)'
line001line001
line001line002
line001line003
...
line002line001
line002line002
line002line003
...
```

Here `stutter` _must_ keep the entirety of the group to the right of the
product operator `#`, because it will be repeated for each element produced by
the group to the left of the operator. The reason is that `stutter` cannot tell
`stdin` to simply "rewind" and start again from the beginning of the input.
However, consider the slightly different example:

``` sh
$ stutter '(@some_big_file)#(@some_big_file)'
...
```

This command produces the exact same output, but reads `some_big_file`
directly. In this case `stutter` will prefer reading the file from disk over
and over again rather than keeping it in memory. This is something you should
keep in mind if your operation has to perform many disk reads and that your
hard-drive is slow. If the live data is not too big consider threading it
through `stdin` first (I might add an option to enable the behavior when
reading from a file).

For most operations `stutter` should outperform commands composed from several
different programs and shell built-ins. The reason is that `stutter` runs in a
single process (which avoids context switches and inter-process communication),
and that `stutter` is optimized for specific kinds of commands. For instance on
my machine printing the `a` character to `stdout` a million times takes over
three seconds with `echo` while it only takes half a second with `stutter`:

``` sh
$ time (stutter 'a+' | head -n 1000000 | wc -l)
1000000
( stutter 'a+' | head -n 1000000 | wc -l; ) ⤶
        0.62s user 0.13s system 145% cpu 0.515 total
$ time (while true; do echo 'a'; done | head -n 1000000 | wc -l)
1000000
( while true; do; echo 'a'; done | head -n 1000000 | wc -l; ) ⤶
        2.32s user 3.32s system 154% cpu 3.658 total
```


## Implementation


The `stutter` code is spread across two tiny modules and is basically a thin
wrapper around the excellent
[`conduit`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit) library.  The first
module,
[`Stutter.Parser`](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter/blob/3b6aad3f1df6070f2c3a4a61c3e56658f1b21702/src/Stutter/Parser.hs),
is dedicated to parsing the commands. The only exported function is
[`parseGroup`](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter/blob/3b6aad3f1df6070f2c3a4a61c3e56658f1b21702/src/Stutter/Parser.hs#L60):

``` haskell
parseGroup :: Atto.Parser ProducerGroup
parseGroup = ...
```

From a command input by the user `stutter` will try to extract a
[`ProducerGroup`](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter/blob/3b6aad3f1df6070f2c3a4a61c3e56658f1b21702/src/Stutter/Producer.hs#L28),
which is a tree-like data-structure defined in the second module,
[`Stutter.Producer`](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter/blob/3b6aad3f1df6070f2c3a4a61c3e56658f1b21702/src/Stutter/Producer.hs).
The role of `ProducerGroup` is that of an AST:

``` haskell
data ProducerGroup_ a
  = PSum (ProducerGroup_ a) (ProducerGroup_ a)
  | PProduct (ProducerGroup_ a) (ProducerGroup_ a)
  | PZip (ProducerGroup_ a) (ProducerGroup_ a)
  | PRepeat (ProducerGroup_ a)
  | PRanges [Range]
  | PFile FilePath
  | PStdin a
  | PText T.Text
  deriving (Eq, Show, Functor, Foldable, Traversable)
```

The meat of `stutter` is in the
[`produceGroup`](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter/blob/3b6aad3f1df6070f2c3a4a61c3e56658f1b21702/src/Stutter/Producer.hs#L73)
function, also defined in `Stutter.Producer`. This turns a parsed
`ProducerGroup` into a `conduit`
[`Source`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit-1.2.10/docs/Data-Conduit.html#t:Source):

``` haskell
produceGroup
  :: (MonadIO m, MonadResource m)
  => ProducerGroup
  -> Source m T.Text
...
produceGroup (PZip g g') =
    zipSources (produceGroup g) (produceGroup g')
    .| CL.map (uncurry (<>))
...
```

If you look through the code you will see that `produceGroup` doesn't do
anything fancy, it just leverages the `conduit` capabilities.
