This article explores how to reproduce an iPhone animation I really liked, using WebGL and GLSL shaders. We'll dive into several foundational concepts in graphics programming: fragment shaders, radial symmetry and compositing with transparency.

You may have seen this animation in iOS (or iPadOS) if you've tried AirPods' hearing test. It’s fluid, elegant, and deceptively simple. On closer inspection, it’s made up of thousands of small fading dots. Recreating this animation isn't just fun—it’s also a great way to learn how GPU-based rendering works at a low level using GLSL.

## Anatomy of an Animation

If you squint at the animation, you'll see it's actually made up of lots of small dots (3328 of them to be exact). That's a lot of dots. If you were to draw them one-by-one, imperative style (like creating `div`s on a page) it would be terribly inefficient. With WebGL however we can leverage the GPU's many, many cores and by using a couple of tricks, we'll make the animation resource usage be the same whether we're drawing 5 dots or 3'000 dots.

For clarity we'll use a simplified version with fewer elements -- though going to the full animation will just be a matter of changing a few parameters.

_Simplified representation of the Hearing Test animation dots_

We’ll first explore how to draw a single dot, then we'll see how we can create repeated radial patterns (like pizza slices) at no extra computing cost by leveraging its radial symmetry, and finally handle overlapping semi-transparent elements (like a row of dots).

## Drawing a single Dot

In WebGL, a fragment shader runs once per pixel. Think of each pixel as a mini processor that decides its own color based on math -- though all pixels share the same program, and the only variation is the pixel's position passed as an input.

Here we will keep things simple and use a single, constant color and we'll focus on varying the _opacity_ of the pixels.

```glsl
float get_opacity(vec2 uv) {
    return ... /* opacity definition here */;
}

void main() {
    vec4 rgb = vec4(...) /* known color */;
    vec2 position = ... /* pixel position magically passed in */;
    gl_FragColor = get_opacity(position) * rgb;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The shader programs technically run once for every "fragment" and not for every "pixel". In this article however I'll use [`quad-shader`](https://github.com/nmattia/quad-shader), an experimental WebGL library I'm developing for this blog, which pretty much maps fragments to pixels. We'll also assume the pixel position is passed in as an argument to the program when it runs for said pixel -- this is also specific to `quad-shader`.

So if we are a pixel, and we know our position, how do we go about figuring out our opacity so that a dot is displayed as a result? As mentioned above, all pixels execute the same program, and only the position (which we'll denote with `uv` here) changes between pixels.

Let's assume we draw a dot of radius `1.`. The most straightforward way is to check if we -- the pixel -- are at most at distance `1.` of the origin.

![image](/images/airpods/single-dot.png)

_Only pixels within the unit circle will be opaque_

If the pixel's distance to the origin is less than `1.`, the pixel should be opaque. Otherwise, it should be transparent.

```glsl
float get_opacity(vec2 uv) {
    if(sqrt(uv.x * uv.x + uv.y * uv.y) < 1.) {
        return 1.; // fully opaque
    } else {
        return 0.; // transparent
    }
}

...
```

Here we calculate the distance of the pixel to the origin using Pythagoras' formula of $d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and, if $d < 1$, set the pixel to fully opaque (`1.`) and otherwise fully transparent (`0.`). This code is very explicit bordering on verbose, though we can leverage two built-in GLSL constructs: [`length()`](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/length.xhtml) and [`step()`](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/step.xhtml).

> [!NOTE]
>
> `step(edge, v)` returns `1.` if `edge < v`, and `0.` otherwise. Therefore, `1. - step(1., distance)` gives `1.` when inside the circle and `0.` outside. The value of `1. - step(edge, v)` is the same as `step(v, edge)` (arguments swapped) though I find it easier to remember that `edge` is always the first argument; hence the `1. - ...` part.

Using `length()` and `step()` we can simplify the code, and the implementation of `get_opacity` might look like this:

import StaticDot from "./airpods-hearing-test-animation/StaticDot.astro";

<StaticDot />

> [!NOTE]

> I've created a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/nmattia/pen/GggxdBM) where you can experiment with various implementations of `get_opacity()`. Open `index.html` and modify the `get_opacity` implementation if you want to follow along.

Try calculating a few values manually if you need to build intuition:

```
let uv := vec2(0., 0.)
  -> length(uv) =
      sqrt(uv.x*uv.x + uv.y*uv.y) =
      sqrt(0.*0. + 0.*0.) = 0.
  -> length(uv) = 0. -> length(uv) < 1.
  -> step(1., length(uv)) = 0.
  -> get_opacity(uv) = 1. - 0. = 1.
  -> pixel is opaque
```

Drawing a dot with a given radius was easy enough, let's now move the dot!

### Moving the Dot

[todo: add intro like "we now know how to draw a dot around the origin; how do we draw it elsewhere? First: change the position; then do as before]

![image](/images/airpods/transform.png)

_Two of the many pixels rendering a dot (disc) of radius `r` centered at `c`_

So effectively we run the same calculation as above to check whether we are inside a unit circle, but we first move.

import MovingDot from "./airpods-hearing-test-animation/MovingDot.astro";

<MovingDot />

This idea is central: define shapes at the origin, then transform coordinates. If you ever need to draw shapes more complexe than dots, see Inigo Quilez’s [distance functions](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/) reference for a deeper dive.

## Repeating Patterns for Free with Modulo

Now that we can draw one dot and position it wherever we want, let's see how we can draw _multiple_ dots. In general we want repeating patterns, and in the world of shaders we can actually have any number of repetitions for free.

For our animations, we can take advantage of the fact that it's [radially symmetrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry).

In order to simplify things we will work with [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system). As a quick refresher, polar coordinates are a way of representing a point as $(\rho, \theta)$ where $\rho$ is the distance to the origin $[0,0]$ and $\theta$ [explain theta].

$$\theta = arctan(y,x), \rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

In GLSL we can use the following primitives:

```glsl
float theta = atan(uv.y, uv.x)
float rho = length(uv)
```

The trick is to define a general pattern (a gradient to start simple) in terms of $\theta$, and then lie about $\theta$ and repeat it.

![image](/images/airpods/slice.png)

_The slice that is described once and repeated N times_

> [!NOTE]
>
> To simplifiy calculations we work with $\tau = 2 \pi$, referred to as `TAU` in the code. See also [The Tau Manifest](https://www.tauday.com/tau-manifesto). Bottom line: one full rotation is one $\tau$.

If we `mod` the value of theta, pixels with $\theta \in [0, \alpha]$ will get the regular gradient. But then, the gradient will repeat for $\theta \in [\alpha, 2\alpha]$.

Using this we can repeat the pattern any number of times with constant time -- technicall $O(1)$ w.r.t to the number of symmetries or repeated "slices".

import RadialSymmetries from "./airpods-hearing-test-animation/RadialSymmetries.astro";

<RadialSymmetries />

This means that, as long as we can describe a pattern in terms of `theta` and `rho`, we can repeat that pattern radially as many times as we want without any extra resource usage.

### Radially Repeating Dots

Gradients are pretty, but we're here to draw dots. We use the same trick to make $\theta$ repeat, and we use the checks from earlier to figure out if the pixel lands in a dot.

import RadialDots from "./airpods-hearing-test-animation/RadialDots.astro";

<RadialDots />

One added thing here is `slice_ix`, which is the index of the slice the current pixel is in. This is useful if you want to vary a parameter based on _which_ slice you're in (if you just used $\theta$ the value would vary within the same slice). This is used in this snippet to give each dot a different opacity.

![image](/images/airpods/slice-indices.png)

_TODO_

## Repeating Dots Horizontally

Next, we need multiple dots per slice. Let's consider the slice with index `0`, extending along the horizontal axis towards (plus) inifinity. We'll have several dots, each at distance `d` from each other, potentially overlapping:

![image](/images/airpods/discs.png)

_Dots separated by distance `d`_

We saw earlier that we could leverage the modulo operator to repeat patterns. This `mod` trick can be used for other parameters, for instance `x` if we want linear symmetries instead of radial symmetries. But we run into an issue.

Can you spot it before playing with the animation below?

import OverlappingDots from "./airpods-hearing-test-animation/OverlappingDots.astro";

<OverlappingDots />

The pattern is repeated exactly and the dots do not mix with each other. This also happens with $\theta$ above, but as long as the dots are smaller than the slices, this is ok.

![image](/images/airpods/overlap.png)

Let's see how we can resolve this.

### Compositing Overlapping Dots

Here unfortunately there is no way to do this in constant time, like with the radial repetitions. While there would be workarounds if we had overlapping opaque discs of different colors, there is no workaround when the opacity is changing. For this we need to calculate the opacity at every point, taking all other (potentially overlapping) discs into account.

If two overlapping dots have opacity `.5` we may be tempted to multiply the individual opacities to get the overlap's opacity, though a quick example shows that this won't work: if the dots have opacity `.5`, the resulting opacity should be _greater_ than the individual opacities, though $0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 < 0.5$.

To get an idea of how we'll solve this, let's take the real world as an example. Odd, right? Though after all, even though we are modeling a virtual animation, our expectations come from experiences "IRL".

Let's assume we have three sheets of the same material which is slightly opaque, and let's say one sheet of the material lets 20% of the light through. We'll say this material is 80% opaque (I have no idea if this is scientifically correct but works as a mental model). Now let's picture a photon (light particle) that has to go through all three sheets of the material.

![image](/images/airpods/photon.png)

_Photon going through sheets of material_

Wave-particular duality notwithstanding, what is the probability that the photon will come out the other side? If one sheet of material -- on average -- blocks 80% of the light, let's say that the photon has 20% chance of going through the first sheet; in other words the probability is $0.2$. The probability of the photon going through _both_ the first sheet and the second sheet would then be $0.2 \cdot 0.2 = 0.04$ and finally the probability woould be $0.008$ for going through all three sheets. The probability that the photon will hit any of the three sheets is then $1 - 0.008 = 0.992$, meaning the resulting _opacity_ is 99.2% (for this definition of opacity).

Using the "transparency" (or one minus the opacity) for the sheets allowed us to multiple the individual tranparency values. Let's say in general transparency is $t = 1 - o$ where $o$ is the opacity. Let's say all the different layers have transparency $t_0, t_1, ...$. Following the 3-sheet-photon idea above, we can calculate the total _opacity_ as one minus the product of the transparencies, or:

$$o = 1 - t = 1 - (t_0 \cdot t_1 \cdot ...) \\ = 1 - \prod t_i \\ = 1 - \prod (1 - o_i)$$

The implementation would look something like this:

import CompositedDots from "./airpods-hearing-test-animation/CompositedDots.astro";

<CompositedDots />

Note that this operation is commutative, so it doesn't matter what order we look at the dots -- though this would be different if we were mixing colors as well.

## Final Result & Conclusion

Putting everything together we get the following. Since everything is rendered in real time, we can animate it based on time, as we as make it react to user interaction (clicks).
