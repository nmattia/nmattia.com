## Employment

**Software Engineer at DFINITY**

I have been working as a Software Engineer at [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org)
since June 2019. I work on automatizing the infrastructure deployments, make
the builds reliable, fast and adaptable, and as an integral member of the
development team of DFINITY's execution platform.

**Software Engineer at Tweag I/O**

I worked as a Haskell consultant at [Tweag I/O][tweag] between September 2016
and July 2019. I have lead projects from when they were moonshots to
production-ready products.

- I was part of the research team for an [EU-funded project][sage] which aimed
  at redefining data storage for the era of extreme data and exascale
  computing.
- I was one of only two developers who created an entirely new data platform
  for a Fortune 500 company. To this day, the platform enables data scientists
  from several continents to easily share large datasets for reproducible
  research.
- I was a core developer of a new form of spreadsheet engine, which
  allows Python, R and other programming languages to be used interactively
  alongside Excel, as well as using large (1GB+) datasets in user sheets. I
  have advised on, and helped implementing the API and database designs, auto
  scaling infrastructure and code quality measures.
- I added support for building Haskell programs in Google's [Bazel] on Windows
  for [Digital Asset][DA]'s [DAML] compiler.

**Platform Engineer at Pusher Ltd.**

I worked at [Pusher Ltd.](https://pusher.com) in London from September 2015 to
July 2016. One of my key lessons at the job was that with every million users
comes a million ways to break a platform.

- I contributed to the design and development of a high-performance,
  distributed PubSub system.
- I developed a pluggable system for monitoring and reporting the performance
  of the platform.
- I wrote `nagios-sink`, a simple service that gathers the statuses of Nagios
  endpoints.

## Education

**2013 -- 2015** **Msc, Information Technology & Electrical Engineering** -- ETHZ, Zurich

_Graduated in *Systems & Control* from the *ITET* department._

**2012 -- 2013** **Erasmus** -- TU Wien, Vienna

_Erasmus year in Vienna as *Elektrotechnik/Bau-ingenieur*._

**2010 -- 2013** **BSc, Micro-Engineering** -- EPFL, Lausanne

_Graduated as a *Microtechnician* from the *MT* department._

## Technical Experience

Open Source
: I contribute to the Open Source projects that I use in my work regularly,
either to bring attention to an issue, to directly fix a bug, or to submit
new features. In addition, I maintain a few projects of my own, including:

    * [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv/) -- Easy dependency management for [Nix](https://nixos.org/ projects).
    * [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com/) -- The Open Source presentation platform.
    * [stutter][stutter] -- A command-line tool that generates strings
      based on regex-like input.
    * [mask][mask] -- the Haskell Makefile parser and generator.

Tools
: **Haskell** is my language of choice for most projects. I have learned to
leverage its powerful type system on many occasions, have contributed to
core libraries, and have a good understanding of its runtime
characteristics.

: **Nix** is my go-to package manager and build system. I contribute to
Nixpkgs, have deployed Nix in production to teams of up to 40 engineers and
have acquired an excellent understanding of its model, capabilities and
limitations.

: I am proficient with **Go**, **Java**, **Ruby**, **C/C++**, **Kubernetes**
and **Terraform**.

: I have a basic knowledge of **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript**,
**Erlang**, **LaTeX** and **x86 assembly**.
